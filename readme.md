#   Instagram Clone Backend

This test project is part of an assignment from Commsult, designed to showcase the development of a full-stack Instagram clone. It includes two projects: a mobile application (using Flutter) and a backend service (using Springboot). The mobile app replicates core Instagram features, such as posting, commenting, and liking, while the backend handles data storage, authentication, and API functionality.

##  Tech Stack and Libraries

- Java with Springboot and Hibernate JPA
- MySQL Database
- Lombok
- JSON Web Token and Springboot Security
- Java Faker
- Docker

##  How To Run
1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/wendywinata128/be-assignment.git
```

2. Set Up Mysql in your computer, Here's an example of how I do this with Docker:
```
docker run -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=true --name mysql_commsult_test -p 3306:3306  mysql
```

3.  Open database.sql and either import the file or run the SQL commands manually to create the necessary database and tables.

4. Start the Spring Boot application. On the first run, it will execute the seeder located in DatabaseSeeder.java to populate initial data.

5.  You can start exploring the APIs. Hereâ€™s an example of a sample user you can use for login:
```
{
    "username": "codi.ziemann",
    "password": "dummy123"
}
```
